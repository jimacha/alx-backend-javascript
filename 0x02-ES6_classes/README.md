## Overview

ES6 Classes is a collection of JavaScript code snippets and examples that demonstrate how to use classes to create objects and define their behavior. It covers various aspects of classes, including class declaration, inheritance, methods, and static members.

## Features

- **Class Declaration:** Learn how to declare classes in ES6 syntax.
- **Class Constructors:** Understand how to create constructors to initialize class instances.
- **Inheritance:** Explore inheritance and how to extend classes in ES6.
- **Class Methods:** Define methods within classes to encapsulate functionality.
- **Static Members:** Learn about static methods and properties associated with classes.

## Examples

This repository contains various examples demonstrating different aspects of ES6 classes. Here are a few examples to get started:

### Example 1: Class Declaration and Instance Creation

```javascript
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  sound() {
    console.log("Some sound");
  }
}

const dog = new Animal("Dog");
dog.sound(); // Output: Some sound
```

### Example 2: Class Inheritance

```javascript
class Bird extends Animal {
  constructor(name, wingspan) {
    super(name);
    this.wingspan = wingspan;
  }

  fly() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is flying with a wingspan of ${this.wingspan} cm.`);
  }
}

const eagle = new Bird("Eagle", 180);
eagle.fly(); // Output: Eagle is flying with a wingspan of 180 cm.
