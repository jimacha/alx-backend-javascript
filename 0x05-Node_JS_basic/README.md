Project Readme: 0x05. NodeJS Basics
Overview
Welcome to the "0x05. NodeJS Basics" project! This project focuses on developing fundamental skills in back-end development using JavaScript, specifically targeting ES6 features, Node.js, and the Express.js framework.

Learning Objectives
Upon completing this project, you should be proficient in the following key areas:

Run JavaScript using Node.js:

Execute JavaScript code using the Node.js runtime environment.
Use Node.js Modules:

Create, import, and use modules in Node.js for better code organization.
Use Specific Node.js Module to Read Files:

Utilize the fs (File System) module in Node.js to read and manipulate files.
Use Process to Access Command Line Arguments and Environment:

Access and use command line arguments and environment variables using the process module.
Create a Small HTTP Server Using Node.js:

Build a basic HTTP server using Node.js to handle HTTP requests and responses.
Create a Small HTTP Server Using Express.js:

Implement web development with Express.js, a popular Node.js web application framework, to create a simple HTTP server.
Create Advanced Routes with Express.js:

Explore and implement advanced routing concepts in Express.js to handle various HTTP methods and URL patterns.
Use ES6 with Node.js with Babel-node:

Incorporate ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) features into Node.js projects using Babel-node for transpilation.
Use Nodemon to Develop Faster:

Enhance development efficiency by integrating Nodemon into the workflow, enabling automatic server restarts upon file changes.
